# ðŸ§¬ ion - upload and share large data objects.

> End to end encrypted, if you want...

Encryption is done on your computer, your data does not hit the cloud unencrypted.

No logs except errors are being collected from [cmd/server](https://github.com/lfaoro/ion/tree/master/cmd/server) -- 
check it.

Your data (in its ciphered form) lives for maximum 24h in a GCS bucket.

## Quick start

```bash
# macOS
brew install lfaoro/tap/ion

# linux (WIP)
curl apionic.com/ion.sh | sh

# developers
go get -u github.com/lfaoro/ion
make install
ion -h

make test
```

## Usage

```bash
$ ion upload genesis.txt

## Leading encryption standard

Authenticated Encryption with Additional Authenticated Data (AEAD) couples confidentiality and integrity. Using the 
most popular AEAD today: AES-GCM. 

The "AES-GCM" algorithm identifier is used to perform authenticated encryption and decryption using AES in 
Galois/Counter Mode mode, as described in [NIST SP 800-38D](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38d/final)

## Motivation

It's hard to find a service one can completely trust -- everybody claims they're encrypting your data, although how can you be sure? 

I believe the only way trust what happens to your data is to see exactly the steps that lead to its manipulation, 
encryption & storage.

ion is F/OSS -- anyone can check how data is being encrypted and handled, spot eventual issues and fix insecurities.

## Compliance (WIP)

Right now lsh stores the encryption keys in a `key` file, located in `$HOME/.config/ion` with `0600` permission
. Ideally we'll have the keys stored in the macOS keychain -- although I don't know if there's something comparable for 
Linux and Windows.

To comply with regulators you might need to generate encryption keys using a Hardware Security Module aka HSM. 

ion comes with a HSM plugin for GCP and AWS. These providers offer HSM as a service. 

Configure the GCP/AWS environment variables in order to activate Cloud HSM; ref: https://.

# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore

# If you have both a go.mod file and a vendor directory at the root of your
# project, the contents of the vendor directory will be ignored when your
# function is built in the cloud
go.mod
go.sum

node_modules
#!include:.gitignore
